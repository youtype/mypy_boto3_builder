## How to install

### From PyPI with pip

Install `types-aiobotocore` to add type annotations for `aiobotocore` package.

```bash
# install type annotations only for aiobotocore
python -m pip install types-aiobotocore

# install `aiobotocore` type annotations
# for ec2, s3, rds, lambda, sqs, dynamo and cloudformation
# Consumes ~7 MB of space
python -m pip install 'types-aiobotocore[essential]'

# Lite version does not provide session.create_client overloads
# it is more RAM-friendly, but requires explicit type annotations
python -m pip install 'types-aiobotocore-lite[essential]'

# or install annotations for services you use
python -m pip install 'types-aiobotocore[acm,apigateway]'
```

## How to uninstall

```bash
# uninstall types-aiobotocore
python -m pip uninstall -y boto3-stubs types-aiobotocore

# uninstall submodules
python -m pip freeze | grep mypy-aiobotocore | xargs python -m pip uninstall -y
```

## Usage

### VSCode

- Install [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- Install [Pylance extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- Set `Pylance` as your Python Language Server
- Install `types-aiobotocore` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'types-aiobotocore[s3,ec2]'`

Both type checking and auto-complete should work for installed `aiobotocore` services.
No explicit type annotations required, write your `aiobotocore` code as usual.

### PyCharm

- Install `types-aiobotocore` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'types-aiobotocore[s3,ec2]'`
- Install `mypy_boto3_builder`: `pip install mypy_boto3_builder`
- Generate stubs in `<project_root>/typings` directory for services you use

```bash
python -m mypy_boto3_builder --product aiobotocore --installed typings -d -s s3 ec2
```

- Add `<project_root>/typings` folder to your [Interpreter Paths](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/stubs.html#reuse-stubs)

Since stubs are stored in your project root, you do not need to re-generate them after update.

### Emacs

- Install `types-aiobotocore` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'types-aiobotocore[s3,ec2]'`
- Install
  [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package),
  [lsp](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/),
  [company](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode) and
  [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) packages
- Install [lsp-pyright](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-pyright) package

```elisp
(use-package lsp-pyright
  :ensure t
  :hook (python-mode . (lambda ()
                          (require 'lsp-pyright)
                          (lsp)))  ; or lsp-deferred
  :init (when (executable-find "python3")
          (setq lsp-pyright-python-executable-cmd "python3"))
  )
```

- Make sure emacs uses the environment where you have installed `types-aiobotocore`

### Sublime Text

- Install `types-aiobotocore` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'types-aiobotocore[s3,ec2]'`
- Install [LSP-pyright](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-pyright) package
- Make sure emacs uses the environment where you have installed `types-aiobotocore`

### Other IDEs

Not tested, but as long as your IDE supports `mypy` or `pyright`, everything should work.

### mypy

- Install `mypy`: `python -m pip install mypy`
- Install `types-aiobotocore` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'types-aiobotocore[s3,ec2]'`
- Run `mypy` as usual

Type checking should work for installed `aiobotocore` services.
No explicit type annotations required, write your `aiobotocore` code as usual.

### pyright

- Install `pyright`: `yarn global add pyright`
- Install `types-aiobotocore` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'types-aiobotocore[s3,ec2]'`
- Optionally, you can install `types-aiobotocore` to `typings` folder.

Type checking should work for installed `aiobotocore` services.
No explicit type annotations required, write your `aiobotocore` code as usual.

## How it works

Fully automated [mypy-boto3-builder](https://github.com/vemel/mypy_boto3_builder) carefully generates
type annotations for each service, patiently waiting for `boto3` updates. It delivers
a drop-in type annotations for you and makes sure that:

- All available `boto3` services are covered.
- Each public class and method of every `boto3` service gets valid type annotations
  extracted from the documentation (blame `botocore` docs if types are incorrect).
- Type annotations include up-to-date documentation.
- Link to documentation is provided for every method.
- Code is processed by [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
  and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for readability.

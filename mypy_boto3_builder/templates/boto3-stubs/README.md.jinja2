## Installation

### Basic

Make sure you have [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) installed and activated in your IDE.

Install `boto3-stubs`, to add type annotations for `boto3` package.

```bash
# install type annotations just for boto3
python -m pip install boto3-stubs

# install `boto3` type annotations
# for ec2, s3, rds, lambda, sqs, dynamo and cloudformation
# Consumes ~7 MB of space
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[essential]'

# or install annotations for services you use
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[acm,apigateway]'
```

Use `boto3` with `{{ master_module_name }}` in your project and enjoy type checking.

```python
import boto3

from {{ master_module_name }} import dynamodb

# Enjoy auto-complete from now
client: dynamodb.DynamoDBClient = boto3.client("dynamodb")

# argument hints and correct return type is provided by boto3-stubs
client.query("my_table")
```

### Build services index manually

This package generates a few source files depending on services that you installed.
Generation is done by a post-install script, so as long as you use `pip`, `pipfile`
or `poetry` everything should be done automatically.

However, if you use any other way or notice that services stubs do not work,
you can build services index manually.

```bash
# Use this command when you add or remove service packages
python -m mypy_boto3
```

If you generate `requirements.txt` from `Pipfile.lock`,  you also should build
index manually because package installation order is not the same.

```bash
# Add boto3-stubs with services
pipenv install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'

# Generate requirements.txt file
pipenv lock --requirements > requirements.txt

...

# Install pacakges to your new environment
pip intall requirements.txt

# Generate index
python -m mypy_boto3
```

### How to uninstall

Some files are generated by service post-install scripts, so `pip` does not fully remove packages.
To properly uninstall `boto3-stubs`, use these commands:

```bash
# remove generated files and cache
python -m mypy_boto3 --clean

# remove boto3-stubs
python -m pip uninstall -y boto3-stubs

# remove mypy-boto3 and submodules
python -m pip freeze | grep mypy-boto3 | xargs python -m pip uninstall -y
```

Alternatively you can just remove `mypy_boto3` folder from `site-packages` after uninstall.

```bash
rm -r `python -m site --user-site`/mypy_boto3
```

## Usage

### Basic

- Install [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) and optionally enable it in your IDE
- Install [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3)
- VSCode: Use explicit types for `boto3.client`, `boto3.session.client`,
  `client.get_waiter` and `client.get_paginator` calls to enjoy code auto-complete and
  correct type hints

```python
import boto3

from mypy_boto3 import s3

# you need explicit type annotatins only if your IDE do not support
# function overloads (e.g. VSCode). For PyCharm anf mypy you do not need
# to set types explicitly
client: s3.S3Client = boto3.client("s3")

# IDE autocomplete suggests function name and arguments here
client.create_bucket(Bucket="bucket")

# (mypy) error: Missing positional argument "Key" in call to "get_object" of "S3Client"
client.get_object(Bucket="bucket")

# (mypy) error: Argument "Key" to "get_object" of "S3Client" has incompatible type "None"; expected "str"
client.get_object(Bucket="bucket", Key=None)

resource: s3.S3ServiceResource = boto3.Session(region_name="us-west-1").resource("s3")

# IDE autocomplete suggests function name and arguments here
bucket = resource.Bucket("bucket")

# (mypy) error: Unexpected keyword argument "key" for "upload_file" of "Bucket"; did you mean "Key"?
bucket.upload_file(Filename="my.txt", key="my-txt")

# waiters and paginators are annotated as well
waiter: s3.BucketExistsWaiter = client.get_waiter("bucket_exists")
paginator: s3.ListMultipartUploadsPaginator = client.get_paginator(
    "list_multipart_uploads"
)
```

### Setup your IDE

### VSCode

- Install [Official Python extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python)
- Install [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)
- Activate `mypy` checking in settings: `"python.linting.mypyEnabled": true`
- Install `boto3-stubs` with `boto3` services you use
- Use [explicit type annotations](#explicit-type-annotations) because
  function overload [is not fully supported](https://github.com/microsoft/python-language-server/issues/1648)
  in `Python` extension.

### PyCharm

- Install [mypy plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11086-mypy/)
- Install [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)
- Set path to `mypy` in `mypy plugin` settings
- Install `boto3-stubs` with `boto3` services you use
- Use [explicit type annotations](#explicit-type-annotations) for
  `session.client` and `session.resource` calls

Official `mypy` plugin does not work for some reason for me. If you know
how to setup it correctly, please hep me to update this section.

### Other IDEs

- Install [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)
- Set path to `mypy` in `mypy plugin` settings
- Install `boto3-stubs` with `boto3` services you use

You need [explicit type annotations](#explicit-type-annotations) for code
auto-complete, but `mypy` works even without them.

### Explicit type annotations

Automatic type discovery is too stressful for PyCharm and does not work in VSCode.
So implicit type annotations support has been removed as it is not useful.

To get full advantage of `boto3-stubs`, you can set types explicitly.

```python
import boto3

from mypy_boto3 import ec2

# covered by boto3-stubs, no explicit type required
session = boto3.session.Session(region_name="us-west-1")

# by default it is Any, but we explicitly set it to EC2Client
# to make method auto-complete work
ec2_client: ec2.EC2Client = boto3.client("ec2", region_name="us-west-1")

# same for resource
ec2_resource: ec2.EC2ServiceResource = session.resource("ec2")

# PyCharm does not need explicit type annotations here, but VSCode does
bundle_task_complete_waiter: ec2.BundleTaskCompleteWaiter = ec2_client.get_waiter("bundle_task_complete")
describe_volumes_paginator: ec2.DescribeVolumesPaginator = ec2_client.get_paginator("describe_volumes")

# ec2_client, ec2_resource, bundle_task_complete_waiter and describe_volumes_paginator
# now have correct type so IDE autocomplete for methods, arguments and return types
# works as expected. You do not need to specify types explicitly further
```

### Pylint compatibility

It is totally safe to use `TYPE_CHECKING` flag in order to avoid `boto3-stubs`
dependency in production.
However, there is an issue in `pylint` that it complains about undefined
variables. To fix it, set all types to `object` in non-`TYPE_CHECKING` mode.

```python
import boto3
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from mypy_boto3.ec2 import EC2Client, EC2ServiceResource
    from mypy_boto3.ec2.waiters import BundleTaskCompleteWaiter
    from mypy_boto3.ec2.paginators import DescribeVolumesPaginator
else:
    EC2Client = object
    EC2ServiceResource = object
    BundleTaskCompleteWaiter = object
    DescribeVolumesPaginator = object

...
```

## How it works

Fully automated [mypy-boto3-builder](https://github.com/vemel/mypy_boto3_builder) carefully generates
type annotations for each service, patiently waiting for `boto3` updates. It delivers
a drop-in type annotations for you and makes sure that:

- All available `boto3` services are covered.
- Each public class and method of every `boto3` service gets valid type annotations
  extracted from the documentation (blame `botocore` docs if types are incorrect).
- Type annotations include up-to-date documentation.
- Link to documentation is provided for every method.
- Code is processed by [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for readability.
